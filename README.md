redfocus
========

This utility creates projects in OmniFocus based on issues contained in XML consumed from Redmine.

Redmine issues are consumed from an arbitrary URL, allowing users to construct a custom query for
their desired issues.  For example, a user could create a Redmine query that pulls only new 
issues assigned to the user or the user's team.

Installation
============

`$ sudo python setup.py install`

Usage
=====

    usage: redfocus [-h]
                                omnifocus_folder redmine_issues_url

    One way sync from Redmine to Omnifocus. Will not attempt to sync unless
    OmniFocus is running. Note that for some Redmine installations invalid
    credentials will result in an empty issues list instead of an error.

      omnifocus_folder      Name of the folder in which Redmine issues will be
                            written. Path separator is ////

                            A url fragment that is used to construct issue links.

                            http://localhost/redmine/issues, the issue link will
                            be http://localhost/redmine/issues/1234.
